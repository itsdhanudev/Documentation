## Start by Reading the Docs

Before contributing, we strongly recommend reviewing the core documentation:

- Engine introduction

Understanding these fundamentals ensures your contributions stay consistent with ITsMagic design patterns.

## Ways You Can Help

### Improve Documentation

You can help by:

- Fixing grammar or spelling
- Clarifying confusing explanations
- Adding comments to code samples

### Add Examples

Examples are one of the most valuable contributions.

You may submit:

- Gameplay components
- Movement systems
- Laser or weapon mechanics
- UI components
- Camera behaviors
- Visual effects

Each example should include:

- Clean, minimal code
- A short explanation
- What problem it solves

---

### Report Issues

If you find a problem:

- Open a GitHub issue
- Describe the problem clearly
- Include code or screenshots when possible

Clear reports save time for maintainers and contributors.

Basic process:

1. Fork the Documentation repository
2. Make your changes

## Contribution Guidelines

Please follow these principles:

- Keep code simple and readable
- Use standard ITsMagic Component patterns

Clarity is more important than cleverness.

You don’t need to be an expert to contribute.

If you learned something new, document it.  
If you solved a problem, share it.

Teaching others is one of the fastest ways to improve the engine.
