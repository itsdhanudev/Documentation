## Basic workflow

1. **Create a project**: set the name, location, and initial settings.
2. **Build the scene**: add objects, organize the hierarchy, and configure transforms.
3. **Add components**: each object gets behavior through specific components (rendering, physics, UI, etc.).
4. **Program with Java**: use scripts for logic, events, and automation.
5. **Test and iterate**: run the scene, tweak values, and refine gameplay.

## Where to find each piece of info

- **Java API**: complete reference of all runtime classes.
- **Virtual Attributes**: understand how properties are exposed by getters/setters.
- **Topics and guides**: practical concepts for common tasks.

## Quick tip

If you are looking for a specific feature, start with the closest category (Physics, Rendering, UI, etc.) inside the **Java API** and follow related types.
