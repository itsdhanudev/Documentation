| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `getShape()` | `Shape` | Returns the shape type of the collider. |
| `setShape(Shape)` | `void` | Sets the shape type of the collider. |
| `colliderWithName(String)` | `boolean` | Checks if this object is colliding with an object with the specified name. |
| `isColliding()` | `boolean` | Checks if this object is colliding with anything. |
| `getCollisionList()` | [List]&[lt];[Collision]&[gt]; | Returns a list of all current collisions. |
| `getCollisionsCount()` | `int` | Returns the number of current collisions. |
| `getCollisionAt(int)` | `Collision` | Returns the Collision at the specified index. |
| `componentClassMatch(Component, Component)` | `boolean` | Executes `componentClassMatch` and returns after the underlying engine call finishes. |
| `getEngineComponent()` | `Component` | Executes `getEngineComponent` and returns after the underlying engine call finishes. |
