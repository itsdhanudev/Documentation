```java
public class Laser
```

## Constructors (3)

| Signature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Laser([Raycast]) | Executes `Laser` and returns after the underlying engine call finishes. |
| Laser() | Creates a new instance of Laser. |
| Laser([Color]) | Creates a new instance of Laser. |

## Attributes (1)

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `raycast` | [Raycast] | Represents the `raycast` value stored on this instance. Read or assign to update the property. |

## Virtual Attributes (5)

| Name | Type | Access | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `calculateFaceUV` | [boolean] | `get/set` | Returns whether the laser should try to calculate the UV of the face at the hit point. |
| `color` | [Color] | `get/set` | Returns the color shown in the editor when the Laser hits something. |
| `determineHitCollider` | [boolean] | `get/set` | Returns whether the laser should try to find out which child collider was hit. |
| `noHitColor` | [Color] | `get/set` | Returns the color shown in the editor when the Laser hits nothing. |
| `showGizmo` | [boolean] | `get/set` | Returns whether the gizmo (laser visualization) is shown in the editor. |
