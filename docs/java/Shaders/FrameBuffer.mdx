| FrameBuffer([int], [int], [int]) | Creates a new instance of FrameBuffer. |
| FrameBuffer([int], [int], [int], [int]) | Creates a new instance of FrameBuffer. |
| FrameBuffer([int], [int], [int], [int], [Texture]) | Creates a new instance of FrameBuffer. |

## Attributes (1)

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frameBuffer` | [FrameBuffer] | Represents the `frameBuffer` value stored on this instance. Read or assign to update the property. |
