| AABB([AABB]) | Executes `AABB` and returns after the underlying engine call finishes. |
| AABB() | Executes `AABB` and returns after the underlying engine call finishes. |
| AABB([float], [float], [float], [float], [float], [float]) | Creates a new instance of AABB. |
| AABB([float], [float], [float], [float], [float], [float], [float], [float], [float]) | Creates a new instance of AABB. |
| AABB([Vector3], [Vector3]) | Creates a new instance of AABB. |
| AABB([Vector3], [Vector3], [Vector3]) | Creates a new instance of AABB. |

## Attributes (1)

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `instance` | [AABB] | Represents the `instance` value stored on this instance. Read or assign to update the property. |

| `max` | [Vector3] | `get/set` | Returns the maximum of the bounds. |
| `min` | [Vector3] | `get/set` | Returns the minimum of the bounds. |
| `x` | [float] | `get/set` | Returns the X of the maximum of the bounds. |
| `xn` | [float] | `get/set` | Returns the X of the minimum of the bounds. |
| `y` | [float] | `get/set` | Returns the Y of the maximum of the bounds. |
| `yn` | [float] | `get/set` | Returns the Y of the minimum of the bounds. |
| `z` | [float] | `get/set` | Returns the Z of the maximum of the bounds. |
| `zn` | [float] | `get/set` | Returns the Z of the minimum of the bounds. |

## Methods (6)

| Signature | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lengthMax()` | `float` | Returns the length of the maximum of the bounds. |
| `lengthMin()` | `float` | Returns the length of the minimum of the bounds. |
| `maxDistanceFromCenter()` | `float` | Returns the maximum distance from the center. |
| `isInside(Vector3)` | `boolean` | Returns true if the point is inside the AABB, otherwise returns false. |
