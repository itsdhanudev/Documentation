# Documentation Repository

The official documentation lives in the public GitHub repository:

```
https://github.com/ITsMagic-Software/Documentation
```

A documentação faz deploy automático via GitHub Actions.

## How to add content

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Create or edit files** under `docs/` (or `docs/topics/`) using Markdown.
3. **Keep translations in sync** by updating the matching file under `i18n/pt/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/`.
4. **Commit and open a Pull Request** to the main repository.

## Tips

- Keep the file path and filename identical between `docs/` and each language folder in `i18n/`.
- Use clear titles and short sections to keep pages easy to scan.
- If you add a new topic, add it in all languages to avoid missing pages.
- There is an automated validation that requires every documentation file to exist in all languages.
