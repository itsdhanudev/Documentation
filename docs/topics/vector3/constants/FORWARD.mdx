# Vector3.FORWARD

Represents positive Z direction `(0, 0, 1)`.

## Method Signature

```java
Vector3.forward()
```

## Description

Default forward direction for many movement and camera systems.

## Mathematical Definition

`FORWARD = (0,0,1)`

## Parameters

- None.

## Returns

- `Vector3`: unit vector on +Z.

## Mutability

- Treat as constant/read-only.

## Edge Cases

- Some engines define forward as -Z; verify project convention.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 thrust = Vector3.forward().multiply(acceleration);
```

## Mathematical Example

`FORWARD.cross(RIGHT) = UP` (coordinate-system dependent)
