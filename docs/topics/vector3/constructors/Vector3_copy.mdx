# Vector3.Vector3(Vector3)

Creates a new `Vector3` by copying another vector.

## Method Signature

```java
Vector3(Vector3 value)
```

## Description

Copies all components from `value` into a new instance. Use this when you need a defensive copy before mutation.

## Parameters

- `value` (`Vector3`): source vector.

## Returns

- `Vector3`: new instance with identical component values.

## Mutability

- Does not modify the source vector.

## Edge Cases

- If `value` is null, constructor behavior depends on runtime validation.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 original = new Vector3(3f, 4f, 5f);
Vector3 copy = new Vector3(original);
copy.lerp(new Vector3(0f, 0f, 0f), 0.5f);
```

## Mathematical Example

Input `(3, 4, 5)` -> new instance `(3, 4, 5)`.
