# Vector3.Vector3(int)

Creates a vector where all components receive the same integer value.

## Method Signature

```java
Vector3(int value)
```

## Description

Useful for quick uniform vectors in integer-friendly setups.

## Parameters

- `value` (`int`): promoted to float components.

## Returns

- `Vector3`: new vector `(value, value, value)`.

## Mutability

- New instance creation only.

## Edge Cases

- Large integers may lose precision when represented as float.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 oneHundred = new Vector3(100);
```

## Mathematical Example

`3 -> (3,3,3)`.
