# Vector3.blend()

Instance method on `Vector3`.

## Description

- Blends between this Vector3 and the specified Vector3 based on the provided blend factor (0 to 1) and updates this Vector3. |
- Blends between this Vector3 and the specified X, Y and Z values based on the provided blend factor (0 to 1) and updates this Vector3. |
- Blends between this Vector3 and the specified value based on the provided blend factor (0 to 1) and updates this Vector3. |

## Method Signature

```java
blend(Vector3, float)
blend(float, float, float, float)
blend(float, float)
```

## Mathematical Definition

`\mathbf{r}=\mathrm{lerp}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},t)`

## Parameters

- `Vector3`: 3D vector input.
- `float`: scalar numeric input.

## Returns

- `Vector3`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Does not modify the current vector unless explicitly using a `Local`/`Equal` variant.

## Edge Cases

- Zero vectors can produce degenerate outputs for geometric methods.
- `NaN` and `Infinity` inputs propagate according to IEEE-754 floating-point behavior.
- Repeated operations may accumulate floating-point precision error.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f);
// Call the method according to your overload requirements.
// Example:
// a.blend(...);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
