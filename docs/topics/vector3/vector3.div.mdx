# Vector3.div()

Instance method on `Vector3`.

## Description

- Divides this Vector3 by the specified Vector3 and returns a new Vector3. |
- Divides this Vector3 by the specified X, Y and Z values and returns a new Vector3. |
- Divides this Vector3 by the specified value and returns a new Vector3. |
- Returns the division of this Vector3 by the specified object. |

## Method Signature

```java
div(Vector3)
div(float, float, float)
div(float)
div(Object)
```

## Mathematical Definition

`\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{a}\oslash\mathbf{b}`

## Parameters

- `Vector3`: 3D vector input.
- `float`: scalar numeric input.
- `Object`: polymorphic operand; runtime resolves supported numeric/vector types.

## Returns

- `Vector3`: returned by overloads of this method.
- `T`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Does not modify the current vector unless explicitly using a `Local`/`Equal` variant.

## Edge Cases

- Division by zero can produce `Infinity` or `NaN`.
- Very small denominators amplify floating-point noise.
- Runtime-specific guarding/clamping may apply in engine internals.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(10f, 2f, -5f);
Vector3 b = new Vector3(1f, 0.5f, 3f);
Vector3 result = a.div(b);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
