# Vector3.normalizeLocal()

Instance method on `Vector3`.

## Description

- Normalizes this Vector3 (sets its length to 1). |

## Method Signature

```java
normalizeLocal()
```

## Mathematical Definition

`Component-wise or runtime-defined transformation based on overload.`

## Parameters

- None.

## Returns

- `void`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Mutates the current vector (in-place).

## Edge Cases

- Normalizing a zero-length vector is mathematically undefined.
- Implementations may return zero, unchanged value, or `NaN` components.
- Very small magnitudes can create unstable normalized directions.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f);
// Call the method according to your overload requirements.
// Example:
// a.normalizeLocal(...);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
