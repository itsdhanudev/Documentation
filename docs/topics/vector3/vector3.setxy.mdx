# Vector3.setXY()

Instance method on `Vector3`.

## Description

- Sets the X and Y components of this Vector3 with the values of the specified Vector2. |
- Sets the X and Y components of this Vector3. |

## Method Signature

```java
setXY(Vector2)
setXY(float, float)
```

## Mathematical Definition

`Component-wise or runtime-defined transformation based on overload.`

## Parameters

- `Vector2`: 2D vector used for XY/XZ/YZ component operations.
- `float`: scalar numeric input.

## Returns

- `void`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Mutates the current vector (in-place).

## Edge Cases

- Zero vectors can produce degenerate outputs for geometric methods.
- `NaN` and `Infinity` inputs propagate according to IEEE-754 floating-point behavior.
- Repeated operations may accumulate floating-point precision error.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f);
// Call the method according to your overload requirements.
// Example:
// a.setXY(...);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
