# Vector3.smoothDamp()

Static utility on `Vector3`.

## Description

- Smoothly moves the current vector towards the target vector with smoothing control, maximum speed, in the defined interval. |
- Smoothly moves the current vector towards the target vector with smoothing control, maximum speed, in the defined interval and stores the result in the specified vector. |

## Method Signature

```java
smoothDamp(Vector3, Vector3, Vector3, float, float, float)
smoothDamp(Vector3, Vector3, Vector3, float, float, float, Vector3)
```

## Mathematical Definition

`Component-wise or runtime-defined transformation based on overload.`

## Parameters

- `Vector3`: 3D vector input.
- `float`: scalar numeric input.

## Returns

- `Vector3`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Does not modify the current vector unless explicitly using a `Local`/`Equal` variant.

## Edge Cases

- Zero vectors can produce degenerate outputs for geometric methods.
- `NaN` and `Infinity` inputs propagate according to IEEE-754 floating-point behavior.
- Repeated operations may accumulate floating-point precision error.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f);
// Call the method according to your overload requirements.
// Example:
// a.smoothDamp(...);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
