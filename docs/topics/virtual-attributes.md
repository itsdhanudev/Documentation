# Virtual Attributes

Some classes expose *virtual attributes*. They are backed by getter/setter methods but appear as properties in the editor and scripting system.

## How They Are Mapped

A virtual attribute is created when a method is annotated with `@HideGetSet` and its name starts with `get`, `set`, or `is`. For example:

```java
@HideGetSet
public float getSpeed() { ... }

@HideGetSet
public void setSpeed(float value) { ... }
```

The engine exposes a virtual attribute named `speed`. In this documentation, virtual attributes are listed in their own table so you can quickly identify them.
