# Vetor3.divEqual()

Método de instância em `Vector3`.

## Descrição

- Divides this Vector3 by the specified object. |

## Method Signature

```java
divEqual(Object)
```

## Mathematical Definition

`Component-wise or runtime-defined transformation based on overload.`

## Parameters

- `Object`: polymorphic operand; runtime resolves supported numeric/vector types.

## Retorna

- `void`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Mutates o atual vector (in-place).

## Edge Cases

- Division by zero can produce `Infinity` or `NaN`.
- Very small denominators amplify floating-point noise.
- Runtime-specific guarding/clamping may apply in engine internals.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f);
// Call the method according to your overload requirements.
// Example:
// a.divEqual(...);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
