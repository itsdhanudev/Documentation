# Vetor3.lerpInSeconds()

Método de instância em `Vector3`.

## Descrição

- Interpolates/smoothes between this Vector3 and the specified Vector3 based on the provided speed/interval in one second and updates this Vector3. |
- Interpolates/smoothes between this Vector3 and the specified X, Y and Z values based on the provided speed/interval in one second and updates this Vector3. |
- Interpolates/smoothes between this Vector3 and the specified value based on the provided speed/interval in one second and updates this Vector3. |

## Method Signature

```java
lerpInSeconds(Vector3, float)
lerpInSeconds(float, float, float, float)
lerpInSeconds(float, float)
```

## Mathematical Definition

`Component-wise or runtime-defined transformation based on overload.`

## Parameters

- `Vector3`: 3D vector input.
- `float`: scalar numeric input.

## Retorna

- `void`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Mutates o atual vector (in-place).

## Edge Cases

- Zero vectors can produce degenerate outputs for geometric methods.
- `NaN` and `Infinity` inputs propagate according to IEEE-754 floating-point behavior.
- Repeated operations may accumulate floating-point precision error.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f);
// Call the method according to your overload requirements.
// Example:
// a.lerpInSeconds(...);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
