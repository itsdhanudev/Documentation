# Vetor3.sumEqual()

Método de instância em `Vector3`.

## Descrição

- Sums the specified object to this Vector3. |

## Method Signature

```java
sumEqual(Object)
```

## Mathematical Definition

`Component-wise or runtime-defined transformation based on overload.`

## Parameters

- `Object`: polymorphic operand; runtime resolves supported numeric/vector types.

## Retorna

- `void`: returned by overloads of this method.

## Mutability

- Mutates o atual vector (in-place).

## Edge Cases

- Zero vectors can produce degenerate outputs for geometric methods.
- `NaN` and `Infinity` inputs propagate according to IEEE-754 floating-point behavior.
- Repeated operations may accumulate floating-point precision error.

## Usage Example

```java
Vector3 a = new Vector3(1f, 2f, 3f);
// Call the method according to your overload requirements.
// Example:
// a.sumEqual(...);
```

## Mathematical Example

Example input/output depends on overload; for vector arithmetic operations this is typically computed per-component.
